# LTurtles

A small experiment to explore L-Systems and Python's Turtles. 
It serves as a simple demonstration of recursive growth patterns and automated drawing behavior.

## Features
- Implements **L-Systems** to generate fractal-like patterns.
- Uses **three independent turtles** to create varied designs.
- Dynamically changes colors for a visually appealing effect.
- Automatically **reverses movement** when a turtle reaches screen boundaries.
- Randomized rule selection to generate different outputs on each run.
